# ODEsSolver
A python program that solves ordinary differential equations using the Sympy library.

The user is prompt to enter the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the ODE. Then the user is asked to provide inital conditions in case a IVP (i.e. initial value problem) has to be solved; if the user does not provide initial conditions the program will simply return the general solution of the ODE provided.

A NOTE on Sympy's syntax:
- exponential function: exp(x) for e^x, or exp(-2*x) for e^(-2x)
- sinosoidal functions: sin(3*x) for sin(3x) and cos(-5*x) for cos(-5x)
- logarithmic function: log(x) for ln(x)

Other remarks include: 
- 'y' is the dependent variable, and 'x' is the independent variable.

Finally, if there are any problems or bugs with this program feel free to get in touch..
